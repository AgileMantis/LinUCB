/**
 * Small test class as inspired by John Maxwell (http://john-maxwell.com/post/2017-03-17/). We create a context of two
 * features that represent reading preferences of imaginary news site visitors. The visitors like or dislike sites with
 * sports content (context[0] = 1 or 0) and like or dislike sites with politics content (context[1] = 1 or 0). The
 * features are bound to integers for easier analysis. The bandit should offer one of three sites to the visitor, each
 * having different contents to offer for sports and politics.
 *
 * The algorithm implementation has problems when all context features are 0, as the expected reward will always become 0
 * as well. It is currently not apparent if this is a problem of the implementation of the algorithm itself.
